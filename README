cmtk/cmtkd is a system tool used to access many hosts parallelly, with cmtk/cmtkd, you may
run a command on a host or transfer a file to a host. moreover, cmtk/cmtkd will help you to access
thousands of hosts quickly with the help of multi-threaded programming.

============================================================================================
what is shown in this file?

1) how to compile the source of cmtk and cmtkd
2) make rpms of cmtk and cmtkd so that you may install them on another computer
3) configure cmtk/cmtkd
4) do your job with the help of cmtk/cmtkd

==================================================================

1) COMPILE THE SOURCE CODE
	
 Cmtk communicates with cmtkd based on the ICE (Internet Communications Engine, www.zeroc.com) but not the standard tcp socket. we want the communication to be simple and strong, and more developers with diffrent computer languages on diffrent platform may join in the cmtk, so ICE was selected but not the standard tcp socket.
	
   To compile the source code of cmtk/cmtkd,  ICE develop components is needed to install.
	firstly, download Ice-3.3.1.tar.gz and mcpp-2.7.2.tar.gz, or you may download it from my git:
	
		git clone git://github.com/duanjigang1983/ice-libs.git
	after getting the Ice tar and mcpp tar. try to install them.
Install mcpp

	tar -zxvf mcpp-2.7.2.tar.gz
	cd mcpp-2.7.2
	./configure CFLAGS=-fPIC -enable-mcpplib -enable-shared
	make 
	make install
	ldconfig
Install Ice
	tar -zxvf Ice-3.3.1.tar.gz
	cd Ice-3.3.1/
	cd cpp

	
then change the content of 'prefix' in file "config/Make.rules",default value is:
	prefix                   ?= /opt/Ice-$(VERSION)
we change it to
	prefix                   ?= /usr/local/Ice-$(VERSION)
and now, the working directory is "....Ice-3.3.1/cpp"
	just enter the make and make install command
		make
		make install

attention, when the compiler complains something like "can not find bzlib.h" during the ICE is compiled, try to resolve this by install
then bzip2-devel:
yum install bzip2-devel
and so is expat-devel and db4-devel when expat and db can not be found.


	then, mcpp and ice is successfully installed.


Compiling cmtk and cmtkd.
	To get the source code, run command:
	git clone git://github.com/duanjigang1983/cmtkit.git
then you will get the source dir of cmtkit, which consists of 

		README 		a file
		cmtkitd 	a shell script file to install the cmtkd as a service
		cmtk		a directory where the code of cmtk exists
		cmtkctl		a directory where code of cmctk is stored
		cmtkd		a directory for source code of cmtkd
compile cmctl:
	cd cmctl
	make
then you will get the command cmctl to control cmtk and cmtkd.

compile cmtk
	cd cmtk
	make
	then you get command cmtk to run command
compile cmtkd
	cd cmtkd
	make 
	then you get command cmtkd which will run on all server just like the sshd

If there are any errors in your compiling, just check the Makefile and your installing position of Ice and MCPP.

	sofar, all compiling of cmtkid is OK

2) MAKE RPMS


3)CONFIGURE CMTK AND CMTKD


4)USING IT IN YOUR JOB
test
